For this project, I am accessing the Tumblr API and gathering posts from two different blogs - Forbes and Rolling Stones.

-The Forbes search will return the 50 most recent posts. For each post I will be accessing the title, short_url, date posted, and the unique post ID number.

-The Rollings Stones search returns 20 posts that include “Led Zeppelin” as one of its tags. For each of these posts, I will be accessing the post summary, short_url, date posted, and number of tags.

Data in the two csv files (forbes.csv and rolling_stone.csv will include four columns for each search, including all of the information mentioned above. The only difference is the last column - id # of post for Forbes and # of tags for each post for Rolling Stone.
